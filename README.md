# Building Builder

An easy editor for multi-story buildings of all kinds.

## Tutorial

In order to make a building, you will first need to draw a surface plan.

### How to make a surface plan

Step 1: Select the "Surface Plan" tool (the isometric grid icon).

Step 2: Click on points on the grid.

Step 3: Right click or click the red check mark near the top of the screen to close your surface plan.

Buildings are made of floors, so you will need to make your first floor.

### How to make a floor

Step 1: Select the "Floor" tool (the room with no ceiling icon).

Step 2: Click on points within the surface plan.

Step 3: Right click or click the red check mark near the top of the screen to close your floor. A ceiling and floor will be automatically generated.

Now you have a floor, but there's no door to get in.

### How to make furniture

Step 1: Select the "Furniture" tool (the wardrobe icon).

Step 2: On the left, there should now be a menu. Select any furniture item, for example a door.

Step 3: When you hover over a furniture item, it will say whether it can be attached to floors, walls, or ceilings, and in the case of walls, whether it's anchored to the ground or not. In any case, hover over your spot on a supported surface.

You now have a simple building! But what if you made a mistake?

### How to edit things

Step 1: Select the "Select" tool (the mouse cursor icon).

Step 2a: To edit walls, grab one of the newly visible vertices and drag it, or press delete while holding the mouse button to remove it. To add a new vertex, simply click on a wall and a vertex will be added there. Any furiture will automatically move to accomodate the new space.

Step 2b: To edit furniture, click the furniture and drag it, or press delete while holding the mouse button to remove it.

Now, you have a 2D plan of your building. But what if you want to view it in 3D?

### How to switch to 3D mode

Step 1: Select the "Switch View" tool (the white cube icon).

Step 2: A dropdown will appear. Select the "3D mode" option.

Step 3: To move around in 3D, use Shift + Middle Mouse, or Shift + \ to pan, Middle Mouse or \ to rotate, and Scroll Wheel or Drag with Two Fingers to zoom in and out.
